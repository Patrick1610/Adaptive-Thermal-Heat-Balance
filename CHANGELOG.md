# Changelog

## 0.1.18

- Apply the first valid target after start, reload or mandatory-input recovery without carrying
  forward an obsolete environmental-slew baseline.
- Treat occupancy, setback, comfort level, Boost, Enable and Resume as explicit one-shot policy
  transitions while retaining slew for ordinary sensor changes.
- Expose startup recovery reason, Resume requirement and transition reasons in runtime state.
- Qualify against Home Assistant 2026.9.0 and 2026.9.2.
